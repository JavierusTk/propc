This OPC implementation is based on free prOpc implementation of "Production Robots Engineering Ltd" http://www.prel.co.uk and is extended by new features.

OLE for Process Control or 'OPC' is a well established standard for communication between process plant and software running under Windows. The specifications are designed and maintained by the OPC Foundation a non-profit making organisation founded by many of the leading players in the process control industry.

Programming OPC clients and servers can be a daunting task, especially for those with little or no experience of COM programming. We think you will be surprised how simple OPC server programming can be with the prOpc toolkit; why not download a copy now.

OPC server supports DA1.0, DA2.05 and DA3.0 interfaces and passes OPC Compliance Tests.

**prOpcKit Features:**

  * _OPC Server Wizard_
> By filling in a simple form you can have an OPC data access server up and running in a couple of minutes. The OPC server wizard writes a simple class definition: all you have to do is add the published properties you want visible to your OPC clients. For a quick introduction to the wizard see An Introduction to the Opc Server Wizard.
  * _TOpcSimpleClient component_
> Turn your Delphi application into an OPC client by dropping the TOpcSimpleClient component onto one of your forms.
  * _Build an Instant Client with the 'Very Simple Client' unit_
> Build yourself a moderately serviceable OPC Data Access client in a single line of code. 70% of the functionality for 30% of the work. For a brief explanation of how this works see Using the Very Simple Client.
  * _Complete On-line and tutorial documentation_
> There is a complete manual explaining how to build OPC programs in the simplest possible terms. In addition, there is complete on-line reference documentation in .hlp format, fully compatible with Delphi's OpenHelp system.
  * _Numerous Examples_
> There are a number of example servers and clients provided with the kit.
  * _100% Delphi_
> The prOpcKit libraries are native Delphi. There are no external DLLs.
  * _High Performance_
> All prOpcKit servers and clients based on TOpcSimpleClient use the OPC custom interfaces directly, offering the same performance as C++ implementations.
